# HeliosConnect Litepaper

The HeliosConnect Litepaper provides developers with an in-depth overview of the platform, its architecture, and its technical applications. It outlines the vision behind Helios Connect and demonstrates how it enables cross-chain interoperability, addressing key challenges in the Web3 space.

## Novelty of the event

The **Helios Collabathon** is a pioneering 10-day event designed for Web3 developers and innovators. This event marks the creation of Helios Connect, a cross-chain authentication dApp that bridges the [MultiversX](https://multiversx.com/) and [Injective](https://injective.com/) ecosystems, enabling developers to power multichain "personas" for identity verification.

The event assembled 14 skilled Builders, Smart Contract Developers, Creative professionals, and Project Managers from 11 companies. Together, they’ve won over 15 Hackathons, collaborating to build Helios Connect at a historic 17th-century villa near Barcelona. This unique environment fostered rapid development from concept to an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), showcasing the potential of collective innovation.

## Collabathon vs Hackathon: A Developer Perspective

Unlike traditional hackathons, where developers build isolated projects that often remain unused post-event, a Collabathon is centered around collaboration. The focus is on developing products from all angles—coding, user testing, documentation, marketing, and content creation—until they reach MVP status.

For developers, this means contributing to a cohesive, long-term open-source project designed for actual adoption within the ecosystem. The collaborative approach ensures the product is both functional and supported by thorough documentation, comprehensive marketing efforts, and user-centric design principles. The goal is to create usable tools that integrate easily with other decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 platforms.

## Product

Helios Connect is an open-source, cross-chain authentication dApp that enables multi-chain “personas” by linking wallets across different blockchain networks, starting with [MultiversX](https://multiversx.com/) and [Injective](https://injective.com/). Developers can utilize Helios Connect to build decentralized identity verification mechanisms that transcend individual blockchain ecosystems.

### Key Components

- Cross-Chain Wallet Integration: Helios Connect allows users to link wallets from multiple chains into a single identity, or "persona."
- Identity Verification: Verifies the ownership of wallets across different chains via cryptographic proof.
- Open-Source Foundation: Encourages developers to customize and extend the dApp for various use cases, from authentication to cross-chain interoperability tools.

## Industry Problems

### User Fragmentation

As a developer, one of the biggest challenges in the Web3 space is dealing with fragmented user experiences across different blockchains. Users often need multiple wallets to interact with various chains, leading to a disjointed experience.

This fragmentation complicates your ability to build applications that offer a seamless and user-friendly cross-chain interaction. Managing identities across multiple chains can be cumbersome, with a lack of standardization making integration difficult. Similarly, businesses struggle to create consistent user experiences across these fragmented ecosystems, and automated exploits like bots can devalue features like airdrops.

### Cross-Chain Growth despite friction

Despite some growth, such as the rise in on-chain daily active users (DAU) from 1.25 million in January 2021 to 7.5 million by March 2024—a 146% increase—stagnant adoption remains a concern. Bridging volume, a critical metric of cross-chain activity, is approximately $144 million daily, which pales in comparison to decentralized finance (DeFi) at 1/35th of its volume, and an even smaller fraction of overall assets at 1/700th. This suggests that users are avoiding cross-chain interactions due to the inherent complexities, further reinforcing fragmentation as a major pain point in the industry.
Moreover, the decentralized exchange (DEX) market’s dominance compared to centralized exchanges (CEX) remains low at just 16.56%, according to DefiLlama. This disparity highlights the liquidity fragmentation issue that DeFi faces, further impacting user experience and business performance.

### The Way Forward

While cross-chain activity has seen growth—such as the increase in daily active users from 1.25 million in January 2021 to 7.5 million by March 2024—developers still face friction when building cross-chain solutions. The complexity of working across multiple chains leads to reduced user engagement and adoption. Daily bridging volumes of $144 million (compared to DeFi’s much higher volumes) reflect this hesitation. Additionally, liquidity fragmentation in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) further complicates cross-chain liquidity management.

For developers, solving this fragmentation is key to unlocking smoother user experiences, improved business efficiencies, and new forms of cross-chain innovation.

## Our Solution

### Step by Step Overview for Implementation

Helios Connect allows developers to seamlessly integrate multi-chain personas into their dApps, reducing user fragmentation and enhancing Web3 engagement.

1. Connect Wallet: Users begin by connecting a wallet from a supported chain (e.g., MultiversX).
2. Link Additional Wallets: Users can add wallets from other chains (e.g., Injective) to their profile.
3. Verify Ownership: The user signs a message from each linked wallet, providing cryptographic proof of ownership.
4. Unified Persona: After linking all wallets, the user has a unified cross-chain "persona" that can be used across dApps, allowing for a seamless multi-chain experience.

### Developer Benefits

- Streamlined Identity Management: Developers can integrate a singular cross-chain identity system into their dApps, simplifying UX across ecosystems.
- Cross-Chain Interactions: Enable users to conduct activities (payments, lending, and gamification) across multiple chains using one persona.
- Asset Tracking: Helios Connect also allows users to view their assets across multiple wallets without needing to log in separately, making it a useful tool for dApp developers who want to provide comprehensive asset views across chains.

## Expected Impact

- Improved Cross-Chain UX: Save users time by reducing friction and simplifying cross-chain wallet management.
- Verified Personas: Give developers the ability to provide rewards or features to verified human users, eliminating issues like bots hijacking features such as airdrops.

## Ecosystem Benefits

- User Engagement: Helios Connect encourages users to stay more engaged with ecosystems, even those that are not their primary chain.
- Open-Source Flexibility: The open-source nature of the dApp allows developers to easily integrate it into their own projects and customize it for specific use cases.

## Future Features

Helios Connect serves as a foundational layer for a wide range of future dApp features, and we encourage developers to explore these possibilities:

- Cross-Chain Ticketing Solutions: Build ticketing systems that verify user identity across multiple chains.
- Accounting & Tax Tools: Enable more efficient cross-chain accounting for businesses.
- DAO Integration: Seamlessly verify users in DAOs across different ecosystems.
- Cross-Chain Anti-Scam Scanner: Introduce a safety mechanism to warn users about scam addresses based on verified blacklists.
- Multi-Wallet Signature Services: Provide multi-signature capabilities across different blockchain networks.
- Cross-Chain KYC Services: Build KYC solutions that span multiple chains.
- Persona Integration for GitHub: Link a users cross-chain persona to their GitHub account, enabling cross-ecosystem identity management.

**Anti-Scam Scanner in more depth**

To bolster the security of cross-chain interactions, developers can extend Helios Connect with an anti-scam scanner. This safety feature would automatically scan a wallet or smart contract address to determine if it is listed on a verified blacklist. If so, a red flag would be displayed to alert the user of potential scams, enhancing the security of cross-chain transactions.

We invite developers to contribute to Helios Connect by visiting our GitHub repositories. Feel free to fork, modify, and expand the platform to suit your project needs.
