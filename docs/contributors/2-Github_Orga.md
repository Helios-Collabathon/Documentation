   Developers can contribute to the project by submitting pull requests. Whether you are fixing bugs, implementing new features, or optimizing code, we welcome your contributions. Follow these steps:
   - Fork the relevant repository.
   - Create a branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `fix-wallet-auth` or `add-new-feature`).
   - Make your changes and test them.
   - Submit a pull request (PR) with a detailed explanation of what was changed.

3. Propose New Features:  
   If you have ideas for improving Helios Connect, you can open a new issue on GitHub and tag it as a "Feature Request". Be sure to provide:
   - A clear description of the feature.
   - The problem it solves or the improvement it brings.
   - Possible implementation suggestions.

4. Documentation:  
   If you're passionate about clear communication, you can help improve the documentation:
   - Edit or expand the existing documentation to make it easier for new users to understand.
   - Contribute to tutorials, how-to guides, or technical walkthroughs.
   - Translate the documentation into other languages to broaden the project's reach.

   Help grow the Helios Connect community by engaging in forums, answering questions, and sharing news about the project. You can also help promote Helios Connect on social media or Web3 communities to attract more users and contributors.

## Repositories

The HeliosConnect organization on GitHub consists of several repositories, each responsible for different aspects of the project. Below is an overview of the key repositories and how they are structured:

- Dapp Frontend:  
   This repository contains the source code for the Helios Connect user interface. Contributors can work on improving the UI/UX, fixing frontend bugs, or adding new features that enhance user experience.

- Documentation:  
   The documentation repository holds all the information for users and developers. You can contribute by adding detailed guides, FAQs, technical overviews, or updates to ensure that the docs are up to date with the latest changes in the project.

- Smart Contracts (future):  
   While not yet a standalone repository, future expansions may include a repository dedicated to smart contracts. Contributors with blockchain expertise can optimize, audit, or extend the functionality of these contracts to ensure secure and efficient cross-chain operations.

## Contribution Guidelines

To ensure that contributions are consistent, efficient, and respectful, we have a few guidelines:

### 1. Code of Conduct

All contributors must adhere to the [Helios Connect Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Helios-Collabathon/Dapp/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a welcoming and productive environment. Key points include:

- Be respectful to other contributors.
- Be constructive and collaborate openly.
- Address disagreements respectfully and professionally.

### 2. Pull Request Process

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your changes.
- Ensure that your code follows the style guide used in the repository.
- Write tests for your code if applicable.
- Submit a pull request and link to any relevant issues.

### 3. Review Process

Once a pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by a maintainer. Feedback will be provided, and you may be asked to make changes before the PR is merged. Please be patient, as the review process can take some time.
